Republican-controlled states predominantly passed near-total bans on abortion in the aftermath of the Supreme Court's June 2022 Dobbs v. [MASK0] Women's Health Organization decision. By April 2023, abortion was \"largely illegal\" throughout much of the United States. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, there were 15 states that have de jure early stage bans on abortion explicitly without exceptions for rape or incest: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. In states with laws granting exceptions, it was reported de facto that \"very few exceptions to these new abortion bans have been granted\" and that patients who had been raped or otherwise qualified for exceptions were being turned away, citing \"ambiguous laws and the threat of criminal penalties make them unwilling to test the rules\".", "masks": ["Jackson"]}
