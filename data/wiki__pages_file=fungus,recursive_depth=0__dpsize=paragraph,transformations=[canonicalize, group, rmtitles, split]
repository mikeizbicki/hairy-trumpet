{"masked_text": "[MASK0] (common name includes hairy trumpet) is a species of fungus in the family Polyporaceae in the genus Panus of the Basidiomycota.  P. [MASK0] has a fruiting body in the shape of a funnel with a velvety texture, hence the nickname \"hairy trumpet.\" When it was identified by D. Pegler of Kew,  he created a subgroup of the Lentinus fungi, called Panus based on their hyphal systems.  For this reason, [MASK0] is sometimes referred to as Lentinus [MASK0].  [MASK0] has been described with numerous other names which were combined by Pegler in 1965.", "masks": ["Fasciatus"]}
{"masked_text": "The fungus has a unique shape, with the cap in-rolled when the fungus is young, and then developing a funnel (or infundibuliform) shape over time. It is also known for having pale brown hairs that cover the cap.  In dry conditions, the stalk peels like bark but returns to normal following rain. P. [MASK0] also has deeply decurrent gills, a velvety pileus, and dense hairs.  The fungus can have purple gills that turn brown as they mature.  The spores have a white print.", "masks": ["Fasciatus"]}
{"masked_text": "Basidiospores of P. [MASK0] reside on the hymenium of the gills of the fruiting body. When two germinating basidiospores of opposite mating types fuse via plasmogamy, the two nuclei remain unfused while a basidiocarp fruiting body is formed.  On the gills beneath the cap, numerous basidia are formed.  Karyogamy and meiosis occur and give rise to mature basidiospores. These are then released via the Buller's drop method of spore dispersal.", "masks": ["Fasciatus"]}
{"masked_text": "[MASK0] is a wood-decaying saprotroph that feeds on rotting logs or small branches.", "masks": ["Fasciatus"]}
{"masked_text": "[MASK0] is commonly found in drier woodland environments, amongst the grass, and beneath eucalypts, acacias, and casuarinas.  It is usually exposed to sunlight most of the day.", "masks": ["Fasciatus"]}
{"masked_text": "[MASK0] has been recorded in southern and eastern Australia, Africa, Cameroon, Oceania, Papua New Guinea, and New Caledonia, however, much of its distribution is unknown. It has been recorded in low numbers in the Jarrah forest region of western Australia.", "masks": ["Fasciatus"]}
{"masked_text": "The species was originally described by Miles J. Berkeley in 1840 as Lentinus [MASK0].  It was later renamed by David Pegler of the Kew Royal Botanical Garden in 1965 in the Australian Journal of Botany.  Pegler treated Panus as a subgroup of Lentinus, however another mycologist, Corner, considered Panus and Lentinus as two separate genre based on their hyphal systems, so their relationship is controversial.  These subgroups were identified based on morphology, but held true for the most part upon more molecular research.  Pegler's identification of P. [MASK0] was based on collections from Tasmania gathered by R.C. Dunn and R. W. Lawrence.  P. [MASK0] was among the first fungal species to be identified in Australia.", "masks": ["Fasciatus"]}
{"masked_text": "[MASK0], commonly known as the lilac oysterling, smooth panus, or conch panus, is an inedible species of mushroom that occurs throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Its fruitbodies are characterized by a smooth, lilac- or tan-colored cap, and decurrent gills.  The fungus is saprophytic and fruits on the decomposing wood of a wide variety of deciduous and coniferous trees. Despite being a gilled species, phylogenetic analysis has shown it is closely related to the pored species found in the family Polyporaceae.", "masks": ["Conchatus"]}
{"masked_text": "The species was originally described under the name Agaricus [MASK0] by French mycologist Jean Baptiste Fran\u00e7ois Pierre Bulliard in volume 7 of his 1787 Herbier de la France. Elias Magnus Fries transferred it to the genus Panus in 1838.", "masks": ["Conchatus"]}
{"masked_text": "The specific epithet [MASK0] is derived from the Latin word meaning \"shell-like\". It is commonly known as the lilac oysterling.", "masks": ["Conchatus"]}
{"masked_text": "[MASK0] mushrooms have an extremely variable morphology that changes with the age of the fruitbodies. Young specimens are pliable and fleshy, colored lilac to purple, and have a monomitic hyphal system (containing only generative hyphae). Old fruitbodies lose the coloring and develop a tough texture. They have a dimitic hyphal system, containing both generative and skeletal hyphae. Because of this variability in fruitbody morphology, the fungus has been described several times under different names by different mycologists. The following are heterotypic synonyms of [MASK0] (based on a different type):", "masks": ["Conchatus"]}
{"masked_text": "[MASK0] is a saprobic species \u2013 deriving nutrition from rotting or decaying organic matter \u2013 and fruit bodies can be found on hardwood stumps, logs and sticks, usually crowded together in clusters. Typical hosts include wood of deciduous trees\u2014especially beech, poplar, birch, and oak, and less frequently on ash and elm. Coniferous hosts include fir, spruce, pine, and yew.", "masks": ["Conchatus"]}
{"masked_text": "Although believed to be non-toxic and sometimes eaten when young, P. [MASK0] is not recommended for consumption due to its tough and leathery texture.", "masks": ["Conchatus"]}
{"masked_text": "The general growth form, or habit, of P. [MASK0] is pleurotoid, referring to its growth on wood, the presence of gills, and roughly semicircular-shaped caps and off-center stem attachment to the cap. A study of this and various other pleurotoid species using phylogenetic analysis determined that despite the presence of gills, P. [MASK0] is closely related to mushrooms with pores, hence their placement in the Polyporaceae family.", "masks": ["Conchatus"]}
{"masked_text": "[MASK0] contains a laccase, a polyphenol oxidase enzyme. These enzymes have potential in industrial applications for pulp bleaching, wastewater treatment in mills, and removal of phenolic compounds in the food industry. Most laccases have an active site containing four copper molecules, and are known as blue copper phenol oxidases. P. [MASK0], however, contains a white laccase that lacks the typical blue copper color. The crudely purified enzyme has been used for pulp bleaching and wastewater decoloration in experimental studies.", "masks": ["Conchatus"]}
