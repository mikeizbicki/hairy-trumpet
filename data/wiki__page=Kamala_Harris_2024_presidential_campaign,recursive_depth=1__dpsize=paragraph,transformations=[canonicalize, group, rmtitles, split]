However, FiveThirtyEight's model pointed to the possibility of an Electoral College-popular vote split widening in the final weeks based on [MASK0]'s improvement in swing states like Florida or Pennsylvania. This was due to the demographics targeted by [MASK0]'s campaign which lived in big numbers there, in addition to Clinton's poor performance in several of those swing states in comparison with Obama's performance in 2012, as well as having a big number of her potential voters in very populated traditionally 'blue' states, but also in some very populated states traditionally 'red', like Texas, which were projected safe for [MASK0].", "masks": ["Trump"]}

Nate Silver found that the high number of undecided and third-party voters in the election was neglected in many of these models, and that many of these voters decided to vote for [MASK0].

{"masked_text": "The proposed inclusion of an expanded CTC in the American Rescue Plan Act (ARP) also spurred the creation of several alternative child benefit proposals. In February 2021, shortly after [MASK0] assumed the presidency and Democrats gained a narrow majority in the Senate, Republican Senator Mitt Romney released his \"Family Security Act\", a proposal to provide families with a yearly benefit of $3,000 per child ages 6\u201316 and $4,200 per child ages 0\u20135, with a maximum allowable benefit of $15,000 and the same phaseout structure as the CTC under the TCJA. Like the child tax credit expansion proposed in the American Family Plan and instituted by the ARP, the benefit would be delivered as monthly payments; additionally, it would also allow families to begin claiming the benefit four months before the expected birth date of their child. Unlike the Democratic proposals, Romney's plan would have the benefit administered by the Social Security Administration (SSA) rather than the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The child benefit under Romney's plan would be larger than that of the ARP (except for very large families, who would have their benefit capped under Romney's plan) and would substantially reduce child poverty, though to a lesser extent than the ARP because Romney's plan would be financed in part by substantially reducing the earned income tax credit for taxpayers with children and eliminating Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (as a result, the proposal would actually increase poverty among many single-parent families). Romney also proposed eliminating the state and local tax deduction (which primarily benefits wealthy households and has a negligible effect on child poverty) and the head of household tax filing status to raise revenue for the benefit.", "masks": ["Biden"]}

The court appeared to shift further in 2018, when Kennedy retired and was replaced by Brett Kavanaugh, a known Casey opponent. Because of Roberts's stated positions, he was considered the \"swing vote\" in abortion cases, but his strong support for upholding even wrongly decided cases would make it difficult for Roe or Casey to be challenged.

These bills were to be introduced in states where they would have a high chance of being upheld by state and lower federal courts, so as to set up a case vehicle to reach the Supreme Court. They found the most likely route to success with Mississippi, given that it had only one abortion center, Jackson's Women's Health, which performed abortions only up to the 16th week.

[MASK0], Speaker Mike Johnson and other Republicans asserted the bill allowed 5,000 illegal border crossings per day, though this was misleading, as the 5,000 encounters would only be allowed into the country if they passed asylum hearings or were being held under government supervision. The bill would end the practice of \"catch and release\" that allows migrants entry into the country while they await immigration hearings; instead, migrants would be detained pending hearings. The plan included a tighter asylum application and approval process with speedy removal of migrants who do not qualify, the hiring of thousands more border patrol and asylum officers and an increase in detention capacity. The bill also provided for thousands of work visas for migrant spouses of U.S. citizens awaiting immigrant visas, and 250,000 new visas over five years for people seeking to work in the U.S. or join family members.

Its name changed to The Atlanta Constitution in October 1869. Hemphill became the business manager, a position that he retained until 1901. When Styles was unable to liquidate his holdings in an Albany newspaper, he could not pay for his purchase of the Constitution. He was forced to surrender his interest in the paper to Anderson and Hemphill, who then each owned one half. In 1870 Anderson sold his one half interest in the paper to Col. E. Y. Clarke. In active competition with other Atlanta newspapers, Hemphill hired special trains (one engine and car) to deliver newspapers to the Macon marketplace. The newspaper became such a force that by 1871 it had overwhelmed the Daily Intelligencer, the only Atlanta paper to survive the American Civil War. In August 1875 its name changed to The Atlanta Daily Constitution for two weeks, then to The Constitution again for about a year. In 1876 Captain Evan Howell (a former Intelligencer city editor) purchased the 50 percent interest in the paper from E. Y. Clarke, and became its editor-in-chief. That same year, Joel Chandler [MASK0] began writing for the paper. He soon created the character of Uncle Remus, a black storyteller, as a way of recounting stories from African-American culture.

{"masked_text": "On July 1, 2024, the Supreme Court issued a 6\u20133 decision vacating the decision from the Court of Appeals and holding that presidents had immunity from criminal prosecution for acts conducted under their core constitutional authority as president and presumptive immunity for all official acts, but did not have immunity for any private acts. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the majority opinion, holding that presidents \"may not be prosecuted for exercising [core constitutional powers]\" granted under the Article II of the United States Constitution, such as commanding the military, issuing pardons, vetoing legislation, overseeing foreign relations, managing immigration, and appointing judges. Roberts explained that neither Congress nor the courts have authority to limit powers exclusively granted to the President under the Constitution and delineated the scope of absolute immunity when the president's acts fell outside of his core constitutional powers, writing that absolute immunity did not extend to \"conduct in areas where his authority is shared with Congress\". Roberts wrote that other official acts, described as conduct taken in accordance with the president's \"constitutional and statutory authority\", are granted presumptive immunity but may be prosecuted, provided that prosecutors demonstrate that such charges would not threaten the power and function of the executive branch. The court found that official acts included conduct within the outer perimeter of the president's official responsibilities that is \"not manifestly or palpably beyond [his] authority.\" Courts determining whether acts are official are precluded from examining the motives behind the act or designating an act as unofficial simply due to its alleged violation of the law. Unofficial acts would not enjoy any immunity from criminal prosecution. Testimony and records of the President or his advisors pertaining to  official acts that are determined to be immune from prosecution would also be excluded from introduction as evidence in the prosecution of other acts.  Roberts stated that the presumptive immunity applied to all presidents and \"occupants of the Oval Office\".
