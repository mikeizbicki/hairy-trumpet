After Wheeler's nomination was defeated in the State Senate, House Republicans, with [MASK0]'s support, planned to reject about 1,000 people nominated by Northam to state boards; it was a long-standing custom in Virginia politics for an outgoing governor's nominees to be confirmed with bipartisan support. Many of the nominees had already been serving in their positions for several months. After Democrats responded by threatening to reject all future appointments made by [MASK0], Republicans scaled back their plan and rejected only eleven of Northam's nominees. The rejected nominees had been nominated to the Virginia State Board of Education, the State Air Pollution Control Board, the State Water Control Board, the Virginia Safety and Health Codes Board, and the Virginia Marine Resources Commission.  According to Republican leadership in the Virginia House of Delegates, vacancies were created on these specific boards so that [MASK0] would have greater influence over boards related to his main policy priorities.

In several cases, [MASK0] vetoed bills sponsored by Democratic state senators while signing identical bills that had been sponsored by Republican delegates.

Under Northam, these model policies had mandated that students be allowed access to school facilities and nonathletic school programs corresponding with their gender identity; the policies deferred to the Virginia High School League in matters pertaining to transgender student athletes. The policies also mandated that all school staff use the preferred name and pronoun of each student. Under [MASK0], the model policies were revised by the Virginia Department of Education to mandate that student-access to school facilities and programs be determined by biological sex rather than by gender identity; the policy revisions introduced under [MASK0] also mandate that legal documentation be provided before school records can reflect a change in a student's name or gender and that a written request by a parent be provided before school staff can refer to a student by that student's preferred name or pronoun; even after such a request has been submitted by a parent, [MASK0]'s policies do not require school staff to comply with parental preferences when addressing students.

Several legal scholars and Democratic politicians have argued that [MASK0]'s model policies fail to meet these criteria, and as a result, may be in violation of Virginia law. It has been reported that [MASK0]'s model policies may also be in violation of the Virginia Human Rights Act, which bans schools from discriminating on the basis of gender identity, and that [MASK0]'s policy mandating that students use restrooms corresponding with their biological sex may be unenforceable due to the 2020 court ruling in G.G. v.
